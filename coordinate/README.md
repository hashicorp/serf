# Network Coordinates

To estimate network latency between nodes, Serf assigns each node a network coordinate.  Serf's coordinate system is based on [Vivaldi](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/classes/papers/vivaldi-sigcomm04.pdf).  To improve the performance and stability of the system, we also apply the optimizations listed below:

## Optimizations

### Hierarchical Vivaldi

### Dynamic Adjustment

### Latency Filter

### Neighbor Decay
